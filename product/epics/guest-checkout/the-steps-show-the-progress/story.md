# The steps show the progress and are taken in order

## Story

As a guest in the checkout I want to see which steps I have done and which one I am on, and I cannot skip a
step by accident, so that I always know how far the order is and nothing is missing from it.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- happy-path: progress-bar-on-the-review -->

### Rule: Every step page shows a four-step progress bar

#### progress-bar-on-the-buyer-step
- Given a guest who has just started the checkout
- When the guest opens the buyer step
- Then a progress bar shows the steps "Buyer Info", "Delivery", "Payment" and "Review" in this order, numbered
  1 to 4
- And "Buyer Info" is marked as the current step and none as done

#### progress-bar-on-the-review
- Given a guest who has submitted the buyer, delivery and payment steps
- When the guest opens the review step
- Then the progress bar marks "Buyer Info", "Delivery" and "Payment" as done and "Review" as the current step

#### progress-bar-on-the-confirmation
- Given a guest on the review step
- When the guest presses "Place Order"
- Then the confirmation page's progress bar shows "Buyer Info", "Delivery", "Payment" and "Confirmed", all
  four marked as done

### Rule: A step ahead of the progress opens the current step instead

#### skipping-ahead-opens-the-current-step
- Given a guest who has submitted the buyer step and is on the delivery step
- When the guest opens `/checkout/review` directly
- Then the delivery step opens at `/checkout/delivery`

#### payment-from-the-buyer-step-opens-the-buyer-step
- Given a guest who has just started the checkout
- When the guest opens `/checkout/payment` directly
- Then the buyer step opens at `/checkout/buyer`

### Rule: A step's form sent before the earlier steps are done changes nothing

#### delivery-sent-before-the-buyer-step
- Given a guest who has just started the checkout and has not submitted the buyer step
- When a delivery form with Street Address "Hauptstrasse 1", City "Berlin", Postal Code "10115", Country
  "Germany" and "Standard Shipping" is sent to the shop
- Then the guest ends on the buyer step at `/checkout/buyer`
- And the review cannot be opened afterwards: `/checkout/review` opens the buyer step

#### place-order-before-the-review
- Given a guest who has submitted the buyer and delivery steps and is on the payment step
- When a "Place Order" is sent to the shop
- Then the guest ends on the payment step at `/checkout/payment`
- And no confirmation is shown: the order is not placed

## Out of scope

- The "Back" and "Edit" links to earlier steps — `go-back-to-an-earlier-step-and-change-it`.
- Step pages without any checkout, and after the order — `without-an-open-checkout-the-steps-lead`.

## Notes

- Replay story: `CHK-06` (guest-checkout).
- Inventory: checkout 15, 17, 30, 34 (step order), 40.

## Assumptions

- answered: 2, as a change story in this shop only — the Java shop holds the story (a refused step redirects, and the step guard sends the guest to the step that is open). The .NET shop is brought in line by early-step-leads-to-the-open-step, which this story depends on. This story stays adopted as written. (the-steps-show-the-progress-01)

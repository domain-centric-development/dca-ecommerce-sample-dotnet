# Accept only-an-offered-shipping-method-is-taken?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- an-unknown-shipping-method-is-refused: Given a guest on the delivery step; When the delivery form is sent with Street Address "Hauptstrasse 1", City "Berlin", Postal Code "10115", Country; Then the delivery step opens again with the error "This shipping method is not offered. Please choose another one." — `DcaShop.E2eTests.ChooseDeliveryAddressE2eTest#AShippingMethodTheStepDoesNotOfferOpensTheDeliveryStepAgainWithTheRefusal`

Start the application with `dotnet run --project src/DcaShop.Web`.

## Options
- accepted: the story is delivered.
- a correction: what should be different, written into the story (criteria and an `answered:` line naming this record); the story runs again from plan.

## Answer
answer: accepted

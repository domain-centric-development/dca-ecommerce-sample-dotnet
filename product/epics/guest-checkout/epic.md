# Check out as a guest

## Intent

Customers who have made up their mind still cannot place an order, and first-time buyers will not create an account just to try the shop.

## Goal

A customer places an order in one sitting, without an account, and knows it went through; what they did not buy stays in the cart.

## Outcome

The epic is measured by the outcome event `CheckoutConfirmed`: as long as it is not published in production, the epic has not delivered, however much code exists.

## Journey

A guest with a product in the cart starts the checkout, enters buyer details, a delivery address and a shipping method, chooses a payment provider, places the order from the review and sees the confirmation; afterwards the cart no longer holds what was bought and the product's stock is lower by the quantity bought. A break here means the shop takes no orders at all.

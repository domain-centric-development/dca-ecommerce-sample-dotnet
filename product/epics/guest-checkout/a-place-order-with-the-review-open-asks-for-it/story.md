# A Place Order sent while the review is open asks for the review

## Story

As a guest whose "Place Order" reached the shop before I looked at the review I want the shop to lead me to the
review and say so, so that I place an order only after I have seen it.

## Acceptance criteria

### Rule: A "Place Order" that is refused while the review is open to the guest leads to the review

#### place-order-with-the-review-open-asks-for-the-review (happy path)
- Given a guest whose review step is open to them, but who has not placed the order from it
- When a "Place Order" is sent to the shop from another step page than the review
- Then the guest ends on the review step at `/checkout/review`
- And the page says "Please review your order before placing it."
- And no confirmation is shown: the order is not placed

## Out of scope

- A "Place Order" sent while an earlier step is still missing: it keeps leading to the step still open with
  "Please complete the previous checkout steps first.", as the spec holds today.

## Assumptions

- answered: a — a "Place Order" is accepted only from the review page, the last check before the order. Sent from any
  other step page, with the review open, it leads to the review with "Please review your order before placing it."
  Opening the review page changes no state: the review's own form carries what tells the shop it was sent from there.

- answered: SharedScenariosTest also knows the titles of the stories not yet delivered (their `####` criteria, title = Title line else the key in words); the spec stays the only source for the Test-line and duplicate checks. Fixed on main in 2ea4aaa; nothing changes in this story — run the stage again as it is. (a-place-order-with-the-review-open-asks-for-it-01)
- answered: Commit the two delivered scenarios on main as answered in taking-over-the-guest-cart-is-a-step-of-its-own-02, merge main into this branch, and run the build again as it is. (a-place-order-with-the-review-open-asks-for-it-02)
- answered: a — the delivered stories' scenarios are committed on main now (6a8d286); merge main into the branch and run the build again as it is. (a-place-order-with-the-review-open-asks-for-it-03)

## Notes

- Decided by the user 2026-10-14 (WP-108 side effect T4): the Java shop's sentence in both shops, as a scenario in
  checkout/steps. Kept a draft until the assumption is answered: without a reachable state the scenario's `Given`
  cannot be set up, and its test cannot be red before a build.

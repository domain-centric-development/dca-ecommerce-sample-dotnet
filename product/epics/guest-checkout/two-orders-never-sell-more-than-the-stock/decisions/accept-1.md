# Accept two-orders-never-sell-more-than-the-stock?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- the-order-the-stock-no-longer-covers-is-refused: Given the seeded "Wooden Hexagon Desk Model" with a stock of 8; And two guests, each at the review with "Wooden Hexagon Desk Model" five times; When both press "Place Order" at the same moment; Then exactly one of them sees the confirmation; And the other is back at the review `/checkout/review` with "Not enough stock left for 'Wooden Hexagon Desk Model'. Please adjust your order."; And shortly afterwards the product page of "Wooden Hexagon Desk Model" reads "3 units available" — `DcaShop.E2eTests.TwoOrdersAtOnceE2eTest#OfTwoOrdersPlacedAtOnceOnlyTheOneTheStockCoversIsPlaced`
- place-order-is-refused-when-stock-ran-short: Given a guest at the review with "Wooden Hexagon Desk Model" five times; And another visitor has since bought it five times, leaving 3; When the guest presses "Place Order"; Then the review step stays open at `/checkout/review` and shows "Not enough stock left for 'Wooden Hexagon Desk Model'. Please adjust your order."; And no confirmation is shown; And the product page still reads "3 units available" and the guest's cart still holds the product five times — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.PlaceOrderShortOfStockPageTest#APlaceOrderForMoreThanTheStockLeftNamesTheProductAndChangesNothing`
- place-order-is-refused-when-sold-out: Given a guest at the review with "Wooden Hexagon Desk Model" twice; And another visitor has since bought all 8; When the guest presses "Place Order"; Then the review step stays open at `/checkout/review` and shows "Not enough stock left for 'Wooden Hexagon Desk Model'. Please adjust your order."; And no confirmation is shown — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.PlaceOrderRefusalPageTest#ARefusedPlaceOrderOpensTheReviewAgainWithItsError`

Start the application with `dotnet run --project src/DcaShop.Web`.

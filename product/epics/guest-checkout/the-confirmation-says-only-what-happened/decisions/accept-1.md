# Accept the-confirmation-says-only-what-happened?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- the-confirmation-promises-no-email: Given the guest "jane@example.com" is on the review step; When the guest presses "Place Order"; Then the confirmation page does not say "We've sent a confirmation email"; And it does not say "You can track your order status using your order reference." — `DcaShop.E2eTests.PlaceTheOrderE2eTest#TheConfirmationPromisesNeitherAnEmailNorOrderTracking`
- the-confirmation-shows-the-order-total: Given the guest is on the review step with "Domain-Driven Design" once and "Standard Shipping"; When the guest presses "Place Order"; Then the confirmation page shows "Order Total" "59.98 EUR"; And it does not say "Total Paid" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.ConfirmationOrderTotalTest#TheConfirmationCallsTheAmountTheOrderTotal`

Start the application with `dotnet run --project src/DcaShop.Web`.

## Options
- accepted: the story is delivered.
- a correction: what should be different, written into the story (criteria and an `answered:` line naming this record); the story runs again from plan.

# Accept remove-a-line-from-the-cart?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- remove-takes-the-line-out: Given a guest who added "Domain-Driven Design", "Clean Architecture" and "Team Topologies" once each, in that order; When they press "Remove" on the line "Clean Architecture" on the cart page; Then the cart page shows two lines, "Domain-Driven Design" first and "Team Topologies" second; And the header's cart entry shows the badge "2" — `DcaShop.E2eTests.RemoveFromCartE2eTest#RemoveTakesTheLineOut`
- remove-takes-the-whole-quantity: Given a guest whose cart holds "Domain-Driven Design" with quantity 3 and "Clean Architecture" with quantity 1; When they press "Remove" on the line "Domain-Driven Design"; Then the cart page shows one line, "Clean Architecture" with quantity 1; And it shows "Total Items: 1" and "Total Quantity: 1" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartItemRemovalTest#RemovingALineTakesItsWholeQuantityOut`
- removing-the-last-line-empties-the-cart: Given a guest whose cart holds only "Domain-Driven Design" with quantity 1; When they press "Remove" on that line; Then the cart page shows "Your cart is empty" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartItemRemovalTest#RemovingTheLastLineLeavesAnEmptyCart`
- removing-a-line-already-gone-changes-nothing: Given a guest who opened the cart page with "Domain-Driven Design" and "Clean Architecture" in two tabs and; When they press "Remove" on "Clean Architecture" in the second tab; Then the cart page opens and shows the one line "Domain-Driven Design" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartItemRemovalTest#RemovingALineAnotherTabAlreadyRemovedChangesNothing`
- a-remove-with-a-malformed-line-id-changes-nothing: Given a guest whose cart holds "Domain-Driven Design" with quantity 1; When a "Remove" naming the line "no-such-line" is sent to the shop; Then the cart page opens and still shows "Domain-Driven Design" with quantity 1 — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartItemRemovalTest#ARemoveNamingAMalformedItemIdChangesNothing`

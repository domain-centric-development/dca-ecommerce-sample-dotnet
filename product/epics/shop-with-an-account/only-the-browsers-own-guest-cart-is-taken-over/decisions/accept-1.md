# Accept only-the-browsers-own-guest-cart-is-taken-over?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- another-guests-cart-is-not-taken-over: Given the account "anna.schmidt@example.com", whose cart holds nothing, logged in in a browser that had an empty guest cart; And in another browser a guest added "Clean Architecture" to the cart; When Anna's browser sends the cart take-over for the other browser's guest cart; Then the cart page `/cart` opens and Anna's cart holds nothing; And the other guest's cart still holds "Clean Architecture" with quantity 1 — `DcaShop.E2eTests.AnotherGuestsCartE2eTest#SendingTheTakeOverForAnotherBrowsersGuestCartLeavesBothCartsAsTheyWere`
- another-guests-cart-is-not-merged: Given the account "anna.schmidt@example.com", whose cart holds "Clean Architecture" once, logged in in a browser that had an empty guest cart; And in another browser a guest added `"Ubiquitous Language" Mug` to the cart; When Anna's browser sends the merge choice "Merge Both Carts" for the other browser's guest cart; Then the cart page `/cart` opens and Anna's cart holds only "Clean Architecture" with quantity 1; And the other guest's cart still holds `"Ubiquitous Language" Mug` with quantity 1 — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartRecoveryOnLoginTest#MergingAnotherBrowsersGuestCartLeavesBothCartsAsTheyWere`
- an-outside-return-page-after-the-merge-opens-the-cart: Given the two carts, and the guest opened `/login?returnUrl=https://elsewhere.example/`, logged in and is on the merge page; When they press "Continue" with "Merge Both Carts" chosen; Then the cart page `/cart` opens and shows "Carts merged successfully!" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.CartRecoveryOnLoginTest#MergingAfterALoginWithAnOutsideReturnPageOpensTheCart`

Start the application with `dotnet run --project src/DcaShop.Web`.

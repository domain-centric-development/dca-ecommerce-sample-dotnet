# Checkout refusals say what happened

## Story

As a buyer whose step is refused I want the refusal to name what happened, so that I know what to do next.

## Acceptance criteria

### Rule: A refused step names what changed

#### a-changed-price-is-named-as-a-price-change (happy path)
- Given a buyer on the review of "Clean Architecture" at 39.99
- And the price of "Clean Architecture" changed to 44.99
- When the buyer presses "Place Order"
- Then the review shows that a price changed, not that an item is unavailable

#### a-changed-quantity-is-not-named-a-price-change
- Given a buyer on the review of "Clean Architecture" once
- And the cart's quantity of "Clean Architecture" changed to 2 in another tab
- When the buyer presses "Place Order"
- Then the review shows that the cart changed, not that a price changed

## Assumptions

- open: the words of each refusal: a way to pay withdrawn before Place Order, prices that changed, a changed quantity or product, a shipping method the shop does not offer

## Notes

- From the findings triage of 2026-10-23 (WP-151): a finding that changes behaviour is a story, not a task.
- Each refusal is a row of the findings; the shop that already says it right adopts the criterion.

# Moving between pages is animated

## Story

As a visitor I want moving from page to page to feel like one continuous shop, and to be spared the motion when
I have asked my device for less of it, so that the shop is pleasant to use and does not make me dizzy.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- happy-path: the-frame-stays-while-the-page-changes -->

### Rule: Page changes are animated where the browser supports transitions between pages

#### the-frame-stays-while-the-page-changes
- Given a browser that supports animated transitions between pages
- When the visitor follows "View Details" from the catalogue to "Domain-Driven Design"
- Then the page content changes with a fade, while the header, the logo and the footer stay in place

#### the-product-image-carries-over
- Given a browser that supports animated transitions between pages
- When the visitor follows "View Details" on the card "Domain-Driven Design"
- Then the product's image moves from its place on the card to its place on the product page

#### the-checkout-progress-stays-anchored
- Given a browser that supports animated transitions between pages and a checkout on the buyer step
- When the visitor continues to the delivery step
- Then the checkout progress bar stays in place while the step's form changes

### Rule: Motion is switched off for a visitor who prefers reduced motion

#### reduced-motion-means-no-animation
- Given a browser that supports animated transitions between pages and whose user prefers reduced motion
- When the visitor follows "View Details" from the catalogue to "Domain-Driven Design"
- Then the product page appears without any animation

## Out of scope

- Themes — `the-visitor-chooses-the-shops-look`.
- Browsers without transitions between pages: they change pages as they always do.

## Notes

- Replay story: `FIT-02` (fits-its-surroundings).
- Inventory: cross-cutting X17.

## Assumptions

- answered: A story of its own — the scenario holds as written. Both shops get the change story reduced-motion-stills-the-transitions (no view-transition group animates under prefers-reduced-motion), which this story depends on. This story stays adopted as written, all four scenarios. (moving-between-pages-is-animated-01)
- answered: a — refresh the worktree from main and run the test stage again. The worktree's uncommitted test files of the earlier round were set aside by hand (a copy is kept outside the project), so the story branch moves onto main as it is; the test stage maps reduced-motion-means-no-animation to ReducedMotionE2eTest and writes the other three on the one recorder BasePage has on main.

# Shop through the API

## Intent

Partners who want to offer the range in their own applications have to copy it by hand.

## Goal

A partner application signs in, reads and creates products and runs its own carts, without the shop's pages.

## Outcome

The epic is measured by the outcome event `CartItemAddedToCart` (published when the item was added through the API): as long as it is not published in production, the epic has not delivered, however much code exists.

## Stories

Delivery order is `depends_on`, ties by id.

# The pricing's open findings are closed

Closes the open findings of the pricing context that change nothing an actor sees: test support copied instead of reused, test names and leftovers, weak test data, raw locators, doc comments a rule change made wrong, code the change left without a caller, a rule or literal in two places, names that drifted from the glossary, a twin divergence nobody recorded. Each row's fix stands in its findings row; the delivering gate sets them done.

A change no actor sees: no acceptance criterion, no test stage. A row that turns out to change behaviour is a `## needs-human` of the plan, and goes into a story of its own.

## Notes

- WP-151 decision 4 (the user, 2026-10-23): the open rows as clean-up items, one per bounded context, cart and checkout split into tests and code, after the pipeline closes new findings at their source (dca-factory 0.91.0); every item depends on `the-take-over-leads-only-to-pages-of-the-shop`.
- Finding #1 (a price that rounds to zero) changes what an API client sees; split off on the user's say-so (2026-10-24) into the story `a-price-that-rounds-to-zero-names-the-price`.
- Twin: the rename `UpdatePrice` → `ChangePrice` is needed in the Java sample too, as its own backlog item there; this task changes this shop and its glossary only.

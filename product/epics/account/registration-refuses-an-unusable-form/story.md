# Registration refuses an unusable form

## Story

As a visitor I want the registration to refuse what it cannot accept, say what to check, and keep what I typed,
so that I can correct it without starting over.

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- happy-path: differing-passwords-are-refused -->

### Rule: A refused registration shows one message and keeps everything but the passwords

#### differing-passwords-are-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit First Name "Anna", Last Name "Schmidt", Date of Birth 1990-05-17, Email "anna.schmidt@example.com", Password "Secret123" and Confirm Password "Secret124"
- Then the registration page shows "Passwords do not match"
- And First Name "Anna", Last Name "Schmidt", Date of Birth 1990-05-17 and Email "anna.schmidt@example.com" are still filled in, both password fields are empty
- And the visitor is not logged in

### Rule: The password needs at least 8 characters

#### short-password-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with Password and Confirm Password "Sec123"
- Then the registration page shows "Password must be at least 8 characters"

### Rule: The date of birth must be a real date, and not in the future

#### unreadable-date-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with Date of Birth "17.05.1990"
- Then the registration page shows "Please enter a date like 1990-05-17"

#### future-date-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with Date of Birth 2999-01-01
- Then the registration page shows "Please check the email address, your name and your date of birth."

### Rule: The address must be an email address

#### malformed-email-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with Email "anna.schmidt@example"
- Then the registration page shows "Please check the email address, your name and your date of birth."

### Rule: Both names are required and at most 100 characters long

#### blank-first-name-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with First Name "   "
- Then the registration page shows "Please check the email address, your name and your date of birth."

#### overlong-last-name-is-refused
- Given a visitor with no cookies on `/register`
- When they submit an otherwise valid registration with a Last Name of 101 characters
- Then the registration page shows "Please check the email address, your name and your date of birth."

## Out of scope

- An address that is already registered, and a second registration from the same browser — `one-account-per-address-and-per-browser`.
- The password rules for uppercase, lowercase, digit and 72 bytes — `the-password-policy`.
- Registration refusals through the API — `shop-api`.

## Notes

- Replay story: `ACC-03` (account).
- The browser limits the fields (required, 100 and 72 characters, date input); the refusals above are what the
  shop answers when such a value reaches it anyway.
- Inventory: account A5, A6, A7, A10.

## Assumptions

- answered: 1 — the four scenarios expect the page's sentence for an argument exception, "Please check the email address, your name and your date of birth.", and the story's sentence says the page names what to check, not which entry. It stays adopted; the story text is already changed, in both shops alike. Naming the field is not part of this story. (registration-refuses-an-unusable-form-01)

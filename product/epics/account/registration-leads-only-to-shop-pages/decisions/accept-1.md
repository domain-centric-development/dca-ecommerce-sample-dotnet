# Accept registration-leads-only-to-shop-pages?

## Question
Every gate passed. Look at what the story delivers before it counts as delivered:

- an-outside-return-page-leads-home-after-registering: Given a visitor with no cookies who opened `/register?returnUrl=https://elsewhere.example/`; When they submit a valid registration for "anna.schmidt@example.com"; Then the home page `/` opens and shows "Account created successfully! Welcome!" — `DcaShop.E2eTests.RegistrationE2eTest#ARegistrationOpenedForAnotherSiteLeadsHomeAndSaysTheAccountWasCreated`
- a-scheme-relative-return-page-leads-home-after-registering: Given a visitor with no cookies who opened `/register?returnUrl=//elsewhere.example/`; When they submit a valid registration for "anna.schmidt@example.com"; Then the home page `/` opens and shows "Account created successfully! Welcome!" — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.RegistrationPageTest#ARegistrationOpenedForASchemeRelativeAddressLeadsHomeAndSaysTheAccountWasCreated`
- the-login-link-drops-an-outside-return-page: Given a visitor with no cookies; When they open `/register?returnUrl=https://elsewhere.example/`; Then the "Login here" link leads to `/login` — `DcaShop.IntegrationTests.RegistrationPageTest#TheLoginLinkOfARegistrationOpenedForAnotherSiteLeadsToTheLoginAlone`

Start the application with `dotnet run --project src/DcaShop.Web`.

## Options

#### backoffice-login-page
- Given a browser with no cookies
- When the operator opens `/backoffice/login`
- Then the page heading reads "Backoffice Login"
- And the form has the fields "Username" and "Password" and the button "Login"

- When the operator logs in with username "admin" and password "admin"

- And its summary shows the counters "Total Events", "Completed" and "Incomplete", the total not negative

## Features (application layer)

The Checkout context groups its use cases into three features — domain-named navigation groups below
`Application/`, not model boundaries; every feature works on the one `CheckoutSession` aggregate.

| Feature | Meaning | Use cases |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `Session` | Starting a checkout session from a cart and reading it back in its lifecycle states | `StartCheckout`, `GetActiveCheckoutSession`, `GetCheckoutSession`, `GetConfirmedCheckoutSession` |
| `CheckoutCompletion` | The steps that complete a checkout: buyer information, delivery, payment, confirmation | `SubmitBuyerInfo`, `GetShippingOptions`, `SubmitDelivery`, `GetPaymentProviders`, `SubmitPayment`, `ConfirmCheckout` |
| `CartSync` | Following changes of the underlying cart while the session is active | `SyncCheckoutWithCart` |

`Application/Shared/` stays context-wide. One `CheckoutPageController` serves all five steps, so the web
adapter is not mirrored by feature; the event consumer sits in `Adapter/Incoming/Event/CartSync/`.

## Aggregate Roots

### CheckoutSession

An explicit checkout action captures immutable positions, quantities and prices into a session. Cart edits do not
create or mutate sessions. A new action supersedes the previous OPEN/Active session; confirmed/completed orders remain.
Confirmation and replacement serialize through the same repository operation, including transaction completion.
Superseded confirmation has no completion effect. Abandonment/expiry closes only an open session and leaves cart contents.

Cart reconciliation intersects purchased unit intervals with the current stable position id. Later additions (also of
the same product), removed/re-added positions and other contents survive. Replay and overlapping completed snapshots
cannot remove a unit twice. JDBC/JPA cart persistence preserves the interval allocation watermark; in-memory persistence
retains the same domain state. Legacy CheckedOut/Completed cart statuses remain readable, but snapshot checkout leaves
an active cart editable and never completes the whole cart.

Confirmation retrieves current price/availability/stock facts before its local transaction. Pure domain services consume
immutable line/fact snapshots. Any changed price or shortage reports affected lines and leaves state, totals and events
unchanged. The buyer explicitly starts a fresh checkout against the new prices. Success stores the recomputed total and
publishes the same total; there is no no-argument confirmation path. Local in-memory repository serialization is not a
claim of durable distributed transactions or universal rollback of unenlisted resources.


### BuyerInfo

**Definition:** Contact details of the buyer (email, first and last name, phone) captured in the
first checkout step in order to process the order.

**Type:** Value Object

**Synonyms (avoid):** `Buyer`, `BuyerContact` — both appear in documentation/discussion but are
not modelled in code.

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `BuyerInfoSubmitted`.

**Notes:** Conflicts with `LineItemInfo` in the `CheckoutConfirmed` event — both names use the
`Info` suffix for different concepts (buyer vs. order line item in the event). Possible
consolidation: `Buyer` for the VO, `LineItem` (rename the event variant unambiguously).

### DeliveryAddress

**Definition:** Shipping address consisting of street, optional second street line, city,
postal code, country, and optional state. Captured in the delivery step.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `ShippingOption`, `DeliverySubmitted`.

**Operations:** `FormattedAddress`.

### ShippingOption

**Definition:** Selectable shipping method with identifier, display name, estimated delivery time,
and shipping cost.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `DeliveryAddress`, `CheckoutTotals`, `DeliverySubmitted`.

**Operations:** `IsFree`.

### PaymentSelection

**Definition:** Selected payment method consisting of `PaymentProviderId` and the provider
reference (e.g. payment intent ID) the provider returned when the payment was initiated.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `PaymentProviderId`, `PaymentSubmitted`.

**Operations:** `WithReference`, `HasReference`.

### CheckoutLineItem

**Definition:** A line item within the checkout session — contains product reference, label,
unit price (at the time of addition), quantity, and an optional product image.

**Type:** Value Object

**Identity:** `CheckoutLineItemId`

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `EnrichedCheckoutLineItem`, `LineItemSnapshot`.

**Operations:** `LineTotal`, `WithQuantity`.

**Notes:** Deliberately modelled as a Value Object (no separate entity) because identity is only
relevant within the `CheckoutSession`. Conflict: `LineItemInfo` (in the `CheckoutConfirmed` event)
and `LineItemSnapshot` (read model) structurally duplicate parts of the same content.

### CheckoutArticle

**Definition:** The checkout context's view of an article from other contexts — contains current
price, availability, and stock data needed for validation and price display during checkout.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `EnrichedCheckoutLineItem`, `CheckoutCart`, `ICheckoutArticlePriceResolver`.

**Operations:** `HasStockFor`.

**Notes:** Anti-Corruption Layer representation; no direct coupling to Product Catalog, Inventory,
or Pricing.

### EnrichedCheckoutLineItem

**Definition:** Combination of a historical `CheckoutLineItem` line and current `CheckoutArticle`
data; enables business comparisons such as price change since addition and sufficient stock.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CheckoutLineItem`, `CheckoutArticle`, `CheckoutCart`.

**Operations:** `CurrentLineTotal`, `OriginalLineTotal`, `HasPriceChanged`, `PriceDifference`,
`HasSufficientStock`, `IsValidForCheckout`.

### CheckoutCart

**Definition:** "Smart Shopping Cart" — enriched view of all line items in a checkout session
including current prices, price-change detection, and validity checking. Serves as a
read-optimized view for the summary and review screens.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CartId`, `CustomerId`, `EnrichedCheckoutLineItem`, `CheckoutCartFactory`,
`CheckoutCartSnapshot`.

**Operations:** `CalculateCurrentSubtotal`, `CalculateOriginalSubtotal`, `TotalPriceDifference`,
`HasAnyPriceChanges`, `ItemsWithPriceChanges`, `IsValidForCheckout`, `InvalidItems`,
`UnavailableItems`, `ItemsWithInsufficientStock`, `ItemCount`, `TotalQuantity`.

**Notes:** Conflicts with `CheckoutSession.LineItems` — both represent "cart inside checkout",
but `CheckoutSession` holds raw snapshots while `CheckoutCart` holds the enriched view. Also
structurally overlaps with `CheckoutCartSnapshot` (read model). Possible cleanup: rebrand
`CheckoutCart` as a pure review/display construct or unify it with the snapshot. External DTOs
`CartData`/`CartItemData` should be renamed in favor of `CartSnapshot`.

### CheckoutTotals

**Definition:** Calculated amounts of a checkout session: subtotal, shipping, tax, and grand
total.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `Money`, `ShippingOption`.

**Operations:** `Of`, `Calculate`, `Zero`, `WithShipping`, `WithTax`.

### CheckoutValidationResult

**Definition:** Result of validating the line items against current price and availability data;
contains a list of `ValidationError` entries.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `ValidationError`, `ICheckoutArticlePriceResolver`, `CheckoutSession`.

**Operations:** `IsValid`, `Valid`, `WithErrors`, `WithError`.

### ValidationError

**Definition:** A specific violation of checkout preconditions for a line item (e.g. product
unavailable, insufficient stock).

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CheckoutValidationResult`, `ErrorType`, `ProductId`.

**Operations:** `ProductUnavailable`, `InsufficientStock`.

### CheckoutStep

**Definition:** Step in the checkout flow (`BuyerInfo`, `Delivery`, `Payment`, `Review`,
`Confirmation`) with a defined order and navigation rules.

**Type:** Value Object (Enum)

**Operations:** `IsBefore`, `IsAfter`, `IsTerminal`, `Next`, `Previous`.

### StepAccess

**Definition:** The domain's answer to "may this checkout step be opened?": granted, redirect to
another step, or back to the cart (no usable session).

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `CheckoutStep`, `CheckoutStepValidator`.

**Operations:** `Grant()`, `RedirectTo(step)`, `BackToCart()`, `Granted`, `IsBackToCart`.

**Notes:** Carries a step, never a URL — the incoming adapter turns it into a route.

### CheckoutSessionStatus

ACTIVE/Active is the open, modifiable session. CONFIRMED/Confirmed may complete; COMPLETED/Completed is final. SUPERSEDED/Superseded, ABANDONED/Abandoned and EXPIRED/Expired reject confirmation. Only an open session may be replaced, abandoned or expired.

### ErrorType

**Definition:** Classification of a validation error (`ProductUnavailable`,
`InsufficientStock`).

**Type:** Value Object (Enum)

### CheckoutSessionId

**Definition:** Unique identifier of a checkout session.

**Type:** Value Object (ID)

**Operations:** `Generate`, `Of`.

### CheckoutLineItemId

**Definition:** Unique identifier of a line item within a checkout session.

**Type:** Value Object (ID)

### CartId

**Definition:** Context-local identifier of the underlying shopping cart.

**Type:** Value Object (ID)

**Notes:** Deliberate copy of the external cart identity; avoids direct coupling to the Cart
bounded context.

### CustomerId

**Definition:** Context-local identifier of the customer (may be a guest session).

**Type:** Value Object (ID)

**Notes:** Polysemy — the same name also exists in the Cart context and is semantically related
to `UserId`/`AccountId` in the Account context. To be resolved whether `UserId` from the Shared
Kernel should be used here.

### PaymentProviderId

**Definition:** Identifier of an external payment provider. The sample registers a single one,
`mock`, standing in for a real provider such as Stripe, PayPal or invoice.

**Type:** Value Object (ID)

### ArticlePrice

**Definition:** Bundle of current article price, availability, and stock level returned by the
`ICheckoutArticlePriceResolver`.

**Type:** Value Object

**Related terms:** `ICheckoutArticlePriceResolver`.

## Domain Events

### CheckoutSessionStarted

**Definition:** A new checkout session has been started from a shopping cart.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `CartId`, `CustomerId`.

### BuyerInfoSubmitted

**Definition:** Buyer details have been submitted in the first step.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `BuyerInfo`, `CheckoutSession`.

### DeliverySubmitted

**Definition:** Delivery address and shipping option have been submitted.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `DeliveryAddress`, `ShippingOption`.

### PaymentSubmitted

**Definition:** Payment method has been selected and submitted in the payment step.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `PaymentSelection`, `PaymentProviderId`.

### CheckoutConfirmed

**Definition:** The customer has confirmed the order at the review step; the order is finally
assembled.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `LineItemInfo`, `CheckoutSession`, `CartId`, `CustomerId`.

**Notes:** Not published cross-context directly; an outgoing adapter creates the integration
event `CheckoutConfirmedEvent`. `LineItemInfo` (in the payload) conflicts with `CheckoutLineItem`
and `LineItemSnapshot` — all three structurally describe the same line item for different
purposes.

### CheckoutCompleted

**Definition:** Payment was processed successfully and the order has been finalized.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `Money`, `OrderReference`.

### CheckoutAbandoned

**Definition:** The customer has actively abandoned the checkout.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `CheckoutStep`.

### CheckoutExpired

**Definition:** The checkout session has been invalidated by the system due to inactivity.

**Type:** Domain Event

**Related terms:** `CheckoutStep`.

---

## Domain Services

### CheckoutStepValidator

**Definition:** Enforces navigation rules between the checkout steps: no session sends the customer
back to the cart, terminal and confirmed sessions only reach the confirmation, and a step whose
prerequisites are unfulfilled sends them to the step they are actually on. Going back to a completed
step is allowed.

**Type:** Domain Service

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `CheckoutCartSnapshot`, `CheckoutStep`, `StepAccess`.

**Operations:** `AccessTo(snapshot, targetStep)` — answers with a `StepAccess`.

**Notes:** Decides on the `CheckoutCartSnapshot` read model and knows no routes. The `GetActiveCheckoutSession` query
use case invokes it when a step is requested and delivers the `StepAccess` in its result; the web
adapter (`CheckoutRoutes`) maps the decision to a redirect path.
### CheckoutArticlePriceResolver

Legacy application/test lookup abstraction. CheckoutSession accepts supplied article facts; CheckoutPricing owns cross-article validation and calculation. No repository or remote callback enters the aggregate.

### CheckoutCartFactory

**Definition:** Creates a `CheckoutCart` instance from checkout line items and corresponding
current article data, validating the completeness of the input.

**Type:** Factory

**Related terms:** `CheckoutCart`, `CheckoutLineItem`, `CheckoutArticle`, `EnrichedCheckoutLineItem`.

**Operations:** `Create`, `FromSession`.

---

## Read Models

### CheckoutCartSnapshot

**Definition:** Immutable, query-optimized snapshot of a `CheckoutSession`'s state for display
and read purposes.

**Type:** Concept (Read Model / Value Object)

**Related terms:** `CheckoutSession`, `LineItemSnapshot`.

**Operations:** `From`, `ItemCount`, `TotalQuantity`, `HasBuyerInfo`, `HasDeliveryAddress`,
`HasShippingOption`, `HasPaymentSelection`, `HasTotals`, `HasOrderReference`, `IsActive`,
`IsCompleted`, `IsConfirmed`.

### LineItemSnapshot

**Definition:** Immutable view of a line item from the `CheckoutCartSnapshot`.

**Type:** Concept (Read Model / Value Object)

**Related terms:** `CheckoutLineItem`, `CheckoutCartSnapshot`.

**Operations:** `LineTotal`.

**Notes:** External adapter DTOs `CartData` and `CartItemData` should be renamed to follow this
snapshot naming scheme (`CartSnapshot` / `CartItemSnapshot`).

---

## Open issues from DCA review

- **`BuyerInfo` vs `Buyer`/`BuyerContact`** — Unify the naming scheme; avoid the `Info` suffix.
- **`LineItemInfo` (in `CheckoutConfirmed`) vs `CheckoutLineItem` vs `LineItemSnapshot`** —
  three near-identical structures; define clear roles (event payload vs. aggregate content
  vs. read model).
- **`CheckoutCart` vs `CheckoutSession.LineItems`** — Resolve duplicate "cart" representations;
  consider turning `CheckoutCart` into a pure review/display VO or merging it with the snapshot.
- **`CartData` / `CartItemData` (adapter DTOs) → `CartSnapshot` / `CartItemSnapshot`** —
  Align with the naming convention.
- **`CustomerId` polysemy** — the same name exists in `Cart`, with semantic overlap to `UserId`/
  `AccountId` from `SharedKernel`/`Account`. Clarify which identity is authoritative.

### Shared contract revision (2026-09-09)

Price wraps strictly positive Money; Money is ISO 4217, non-negative, two decimals half-up, maximum 999999999999.99.
Default quantities must be rejected before mutation/reconstitution. ProductCreated is raised by aggregate creation;
product-created v1 exposes only eventId, occurredOn, productId, amount, currency and initialStock.

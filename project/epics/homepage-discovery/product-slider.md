# Product slider on the homepage

## Story

As a shopper I want the homepage to show me a few products of the catalogue in a slider, so that I
can reach a product without going to the catalogue first.

## Acceptance criteria

The sizes are those of the product description: "on the desktop" is size xl, the end-user suite's default browser
window; "on a phone" is size s, as in the shop's other phone checks; m and l are the sizes between.

### Rule: Directly below the hero the homepage shows a slider headed "Discover products"

#### shows-discover-products-slider-below-hero
Title: The homepage shows a "Discover products" slider directly below the hero
- Given the shop has started and seeded its sample catalog
- When the shopper opens the homepage
- Then a slider headed "Discover products" is shown directly below the hero
- And it comes before the section "Why Shop With Us"

### Rule: The slider holds up to eight random products that have a price, drawn anew on every request

#### slider-holds-eight-different-products
Title: The homepage slider holds eight different products of the sample catalog
- Given the shop has started and seeded its sample catalog
- When the shopper opens the homepage
- Then the slider holds 8 product cards
- And each card shows a different product of the sample catalog

#### products-are-drawn-anew-per-request
Title: The homepage slider draws its products anew on every request
- Given the shopper has opened the homepage and noted the 8 products in the slider
- When they reload the homepage 10 times
- Then at least one reload shows a different selection of products

#### product-without-price-is-not-offered
- Given a product of the catalogue has no price
- When the shopper opens the homepage
- Then that product is not among the cards of the slider

#### shows-the-priced-products-there-are
- Given exactly 2 products of the catalogue have a price
- When the shopper opens the homepage
- Then the slider holds 2 product cards, one for each of them

### Rule: A card shows the product's image, name and price and leads to its product page

#### card-shows-image-name-and-price
Title: A slider card shows the product's image, name and price

### Rule: Four cards are in view side by side on sizes xl and l, two on size m, one on size s

#### desktop-shows-four-cards-side-by-side
Title: On the desktop the slider shows four of its cards side by side

- And "Previous" is disabled

### Rule: Previous and Next move by one card, by mouse or keyboard, and are disabled at the start and at the end

#### desktop-next-moves-by-one-card

- Given the shopper has opened the homepage on a phone and the first card is in view

## Out of scope

- Popularity — "most popular products" is the later wish; this story shows random products.
- Personalisation — every shopper gets the same kind of selection.
- A Recommendation context — a later option, not this story.
- An add-to-cart button on the card — the card leads to the product page.
- The slider in the REST API or the MCP server — page only.

## Assumptions

- answered: Where does the slider live? — In `product`; the homepage shows it the way it shows the mini basket, and Portal references no other context.
- answered: Is the slider shown when no product has a price? — No, it is not shown. (Today's homepage has no slider, so this holds already and is not a criterion; the plan guards it.)
- answered: Are out-of-stock products offered? — Yes, as long as they have a price.
- answered: How many cards are in view at once? — 4 side by side on sizes xl and l, 2 on size m, 1 on size s; paged by Previous and Next one card at a time, no auto-play.
- answered: What happens at the ends? — "Next" is disabled at the last card, "Previous" at the first; paging stops at the start as it stops at the end.
- answered: Fewer than 8 products with a price? — The slider shows those there are.
- answered: Where exactly? — Directly below the hero, before "Why Shop With Us".
- answered: Does the browser test need the shared specification? — Yes: the browser-observable scenarios are in the specification's `scenarios.md` under `scenario.home.slider-*`; their browser tests carry the scenario titles verbatim. The two scenarios that need a catalogue other than the seeded one (a product without a price, only 2 priced products) are not shared scenarios.
